Description: =========
        uncountry
        =========
        
        uncountry provides databases for standards:
        
        UNstats
          Countries
              
        The package includes a copy from Debian's `pkg-isocodes` and makes the data
        accessible through a Python API.
		
		The package includes a shameless copy of pycountry's methods, in the hope that it might eventually become part of pycountry.
        
        Countries (Unstats)
        ====================
        
        Countries are accessible through a database object that is already configured
        upon import of uncountry and works as an iterable:
        
          >>> import uncountry
          >>> len(uncountry.countries)
          248
          >>> list(uncountry.countries)[0]
          <uncountry.db.Country object at 0x...>
        
        Specific countries can be looked up by their various codes and provide the
        information included in the standard as attributes:
        
          >>> germany = uncountry.countries.get(code='276')
          >>> germany
          <pycountry.db.Country object at 0x...>
          >>> germany.code
          u'276'
          >>> germany.name
          u'Germany'
        
        Note that historic countries are mostly not included in this list.
